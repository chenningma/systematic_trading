SF1,calendardate,Calendar Date,date (YYYY-MM-DD),,,,,,,,[Entity] The Calendar Date represents the normalized [ReportPeriod].

We also employ offsets in order to maximise comparability of the period across companies. For example consider two companies: one with a quarter ending on 2018-07-24; and the other with a quarter ending on 2018-06-28. A naive normalization process would assign these to differing calendar quarters of 2018-09-30 and 2018-06-30 respectively. However; we assign these both to the 2018-06-30 calendar quarter because this maximises the overlap in the report periods in question and therefore the comparability of this period.
